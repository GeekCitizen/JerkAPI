<H1>JerkAPI</H1>
A new and easy way to build a microservice.
Principle: you describe your service and it provides everything through an API, automatically refreshing.
I started this project for my personal needs in home automation. I would like to be able to have a central point to push/pull all information that I cannot handle through my home automation system (currently jeedom, but who knows).

<H1>How to use it</H1>
<H2>Projet status</H2>
As of now (Oct-14 2017), the project is starting.

<H2>Delivery</H2>
I expect to deliver this project through a docker container. However, I may finally release it through another containerization system (Kurbernetes is amongst those).<br />
You may run the code on a standalone system (Tested for Linux however). I'm happy to hear feedback (Really).
